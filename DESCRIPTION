Description: This package implements the concept of representative trees from
    ensemble tree-based learners introduced by Banerjee, et al, (2012).
    Representative trees are, in some sense, trees in the ensemble which are on
    average the "closest" to all the other trees in the ensemble. Several trees
    can be representative of the ensemble in general. This package currently
    implements the d2 metric of tree closeness (close in prediction) from
    Banerjee, et al, 2012
Depends:
